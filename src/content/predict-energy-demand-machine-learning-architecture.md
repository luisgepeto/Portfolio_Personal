Machine Learning (ML) in the age of cloud computing has become ubiquitous. Many of the ML resources on the net go over the concepts of training, or theory behind the algorithms. This is vital if you plan to create a succesfull ML model. However, as engineers it is also crucial to put the results generated by our machine learning model at the hands of our users. For that we need a scalable and reliable architecture that can be reused across many products. This post will go over a sample architecture that might fit your needs.

# Our tech stack
Our architecture will have a main focus on the following Azure resources:

## [Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)](https://studio.azureml.net/)
> *A a powerful low-code drag-and-drop machine learning builder. In here you can import your data, create Jupyter notebooks to extract insights and train ML models from many different available algorithms. The trained models can be exposed as API endpoints that can be reused.*

We will use Azure ML Studio to train multiple models and internally expose an API per trained model that will be consumed by our prediction workflows.

## [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/)
> *Another low-code drag-and-drop solution to automate business-critial workflows. These workflows can be custom triggered according to the user needs and can use connectors across multiple other Azure services.*

We will use Azure Logic apps in order to

## Some of Azure Service Fabric features 

Some of the features that we have been using on our project are the following. I add some helpful links directly to MSDN if you wish to know more.

* [Stateful services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction#stateful-reliable-services)
* [Stateless services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction#stateless-reliable-services)
* [Actors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction)
* [Service remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-remoting)
* [Docker container orchestration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-containers-linux)

##  Advantages and cool stuff
Azure Service Fabric has given us a lot of cool and fun stuff to learn in the project, as well as the opportunity to experiment (which has resulted in both success and failures). These are some of the advantages that using Service Fabric in our project has given us:

### Cloud native approach 
Azure Service Fabric has given us the opportunity to work closer to the cloud and using some other Azure cloud services (mainly Service Bus Queues and Topics, but also Azure Container Registry).

### Microservices
Since the microservices paradigm is  the core of Azure Service Fabric, we have had the chance to learn more about how to accomodate our business logic to respond to a microservice infrastructure. We have tried to embrace eventual consistency and make sure that any operations on our services due to the updates in other pieces of the system result are idempotent

### Containers
We have the opportunity to experiment with Service Fabric container orchestration (although this approach was later updated). Right now we do interact with docker containers running in each of the Service Fabric nodes, but through a custom approach  and not the native Service Fabric functionality

### Transparent integration among services
Thanks to Service Fabric remoting hooking up services with one another is very easy. As developers this is a huge time saver and simplifies a lot of tasks such as setting up a communication protocol and logic. This is all handled by Service Fabric which automatically sends data to the instance through a reverse proxy. Getting an instance of a running service is as easy as writing the next line:

```csharp
IMyService _myService = ServiceProxy.Create(new Uri("fabric:/MyApplication/MyService")); 
```

## Some of Azure Service Fabric drawbacks
Along our way in the project we have identified some drawbacks of an architecture that is highly dependent on Service Fabric such as:

### Core functionality is massive
Since Service Fabric aims to manage scalable solutions, it has a massive offer of core functionality.  This results in a steep learning curve (see next point). It also can result in a 'development paralysis' since a problem can be solved in many multiple ways. Deciding which is the best for the project is not straightforward and Service Fabric does not make this task easier. In our project we have had to rewrite code many times because the initial solution was not the appropriate one. 

### Steep learning curve
Even if working on the project daily has given us a basic understanding of core functionality, there are a lot of tangential technical concepts that we needed to understand in order to get the most out of a Service Fabric architecture. Some of them are:
* Microservices architecture
* Serialization concepts (WCF serialization)
* Actor model pattern
* Multithreading and stateful programming

### Longer time to market
The complexity of Service Fabric results in longer development time to make sure that everything works as expected. This results in a longer time to market versus a regular monolithic approach.
